  ## Description

  For your convenience, check out the [Demonstration Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Lfe9A240YMtjn-RO8hCrMP3eU7NsWb3j/view).

  Social Network API is the backend to a very basic social media application. I created this to learn practice using MongoDB Atlas as this is a high-demand skill.  MongoDB is a non-relational database that works well with Express, Node, and React. Now, I have practiced using 3 out of 4 of these common tchnologies. While working on this project I learned about embedded documents, cursor methods, subdocuments, aggregates, virtuals, poplutating subdocuments, and using the MongoDB Compass.

  ## Installation

  This application has no seed data, so there is nothing to install. Just clone the repo on your local machine if you'd like to test it out.

  ## Usage

  Start the application by installing the dependencies using `npm i`. After the dependencies have been installed type `npm start` to start testing the API on your machine.

  ## Contributing

  I appeciate you reading this section, but this project will be retired after Nov 11, 2022. There is no need for further contributions.

  ## Tests

  I tested this API with Insomnia, which I recommend to you for testing. I have attached a video demonstration of myself testing the API so you don't have to test it for yourself.
